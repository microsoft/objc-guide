## Convention
Use the instancetype keyword as the return type of methods that return an instance of the class they are called on (or a subclass of that class). These methods include alloc, init, and class factory methods. Using `instancetype` instead of `id` in appropriate places improves type safety in your Objective-C code.

In Objective-C, object initialization is based on the notion of a designated initializer, an initializer method that is responsible for calling one of its superclassâ€™s initializers and then initializing its own instance variables. The designated initializer pattern helps ensure that inherited initializers properly initialize all instance variables. When using `NS_DESIGNATED_INITIALIZER`, mark "init" `NS_UNAVAILABLE`.

For Apple guidelines, please refer [Object Initialization](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/releasenotes/ObjectiveC/ModernizationObjC/AdoptingModernObjective-C/AdoptingModernObjective-C.html)


## Examples

```obj-c
/// bad : in header file
@interface Object : NSObject
- (id)initWithObject:(Foo *)foo; // bad : use of id and not declaring designated initializer if object foo is critical
@end

/// good : in header file
@interface Object : NSObject
- (instancetype)initWithObject:(Foo *)foo NS_DESIGNATED_INITIALIZER; // good: explicit designated initializer
- (instancetype)init NS_UNAVAILABLE; // good make default NSObject init unavailable
@end

/// in .m or .mm file
@implementation Object : 
- (instancetype)initWithObject:(Foo *)foo {
    self = [super init];
    if (self != nil)
    {
        // custom initialization with object foo
    }
    return self
}
@end
```
